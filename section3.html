            The suspension system of the Nissan GT-R (R35) is a multi-link setup designed for high-performance handling and stability. The front features a double-wishbone configuration, while the rear uses a multi-link design to optimize wheel control and traction. Constructed with aluminum components, the suspension reduces weight while maintaining strength. The GT-R is equipped with Bilstein DampTronic adjustable shock absorbers, which allow drivers to switch between different modes for comfort, sport, or track-focused driving. The system continuously monitors and adjusts damping force based on speed, road conditions, and driver input to enhance performance. Additionally, the GT-R incorporates a rear-mounted transaxle, which improves weight distribution by positioning the transmission and differential at the rear. This setup, combined with the ATTESA E-TS all-wheel-drive system, ensures precise handling, cornering stability, and balanced performance in various driving conditions.
