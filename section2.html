            The drivetrain of the Nissan GT-R (R35) is centered around its ATTESA E-TS all-wheel-drive system, which provides dynamic power distribution between the front and rear wheels. The system uses an electronically controlled multi-plate clutch to determine the optimal torque split, primarily sending power to the rear wheels but engaging the front wheels when additional traction is needed. The transmission is a rear-mounted 6-speed dual-clutch automatic, paired with the engine via a carbon-fiber driveshaft. This transaxle layout improves weight distribution for better handling and stability. Gear changes are executed quickly and precisely, with paddle shifters providing manual control when desired. The GT-Râ€™s drivetrain is designed to handle high levels of torque and horsepower, featuring a robust differential and advanced electronic controls to ensure performance and reliability in both street and track settings.
